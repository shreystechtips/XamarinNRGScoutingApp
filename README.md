## XamarinNRGScoutingApp
Start of transition from Android to a cross-platform scouting app for FRC teams to use
### Instructions:
For people who want to help develop this, get Xamarin Studio/Visual Studio from here: https://www.visualstudio.com/xamarin/ Keep in mind that you should be developing the "NRGScouting" folder so that we can acheive the same features across platforms. If you don't have a Mac, you won't be able to see the iOS preview, but don't worry. If you're developing in the correct folder, it should automatically be compatible with both platforms.

### Keep in mind:
This is a work in progress. Right now, there is nothing because I don't know anything about C# programming, so there is going to be slow progress for the first few months as I slowly get more free time to work on this.
